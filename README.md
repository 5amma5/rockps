# rockps

This is my second time completing this project as part of The Odin Project curriculum. [Part 1 Instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

The goal of part 1 is to create a simple command line version of the game rock paper scissors. The purpose is to help better solidify basic function principles.
